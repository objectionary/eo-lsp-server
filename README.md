This is the [LSP] server for [EO](https://github.com/objectionary/eo).
It provides semantic highlighting and parsing error checking for `.eo` files
(written in [EOLANG]).
In order to use it, you need to have [Node] installed.

## Using with Sublime Text

To use this [LSP] server with [Sublime Text], you'll need to install
the [LSP package] and configure it
in `Settings → Package Settings → LSP → Settings`:

```json
{
  "clients": {
    "eo-lsp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "eo-lsp-server@0.1.1", "--stdio"],
      "selector": "source.eo"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, create a syntax definition file in `Packages/User/EO.sublime-syntax`:

```yaml
%YAML 1.2
---
name: EO
file_extensions:
  - eo
scope: source.eo
contexts:
  main:
    - match: '^\+[^\n]+$'
      scope: meta.eo
    - match: '#.*$'
      scope: comment.line.eo
    - match: '[@^*?]'
      scope: keyword.eo
    - match: '[\[\]\\>!:\.\)\(]|\+>'
      scope: keyword.operator.eo
    - match: '"[^"]*"'
      scope: string.quoted.double.eo
    - match: '\b(\+|-)?\d+(\.\d+(e(\+|-)?\d)?)?\b'
      scope: constant.numeric.eo
```

Should work. If it doesn't, [file an issue], we'll help.

## How to Contribute

First, install [Node] modules with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, build the project:

```bash
make
```

Make changes on a new branch.
You can run an instance of [VS Code] with the extension running by hitting `F5`
in the code editor.
After modifications, test your code with:

```bash
make test
```
